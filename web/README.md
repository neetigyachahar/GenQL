## 🔍 How It Works

This tool leverages advanced indexing 🗂️ and vector search 🔎 technology to make database querying as intuitive as possible. Here's how it works:

1. **Schema Indexing:** The first step is to index your database schema 📚. This process creates a structured representation of your tables and columns for efficient querying.
2. **Input:** Enter your query in plain English 📝, describing what you need from the database.
3. **Processing:** The system analyzes your input 🧠 and matches it against the indexed database schema.
4. **Output:**
   - A precise SQL query 🧑‍💻 is generated for your input.
   - A detailed list of referenced tables is displayed, along with match scores 📈 to show relevance and accuracy.

This indexing and query process is particularly useful for large databases with dozens of tables 📦, where vector search ensures accurate results while overcoming AI token count limitations.
