## Extract schema from database

[Download](./schema-sample.csv) sample file.

Since creating the schema in JSON format from the database can be a manual complicated process,
You can simply run the below SQL query to get the schema information and save it in a CSV file.

**Note**: This query is for Postgres. You can convert it for other databases using gen AI.

```sql
SELECT
    c.table_name AS table_name,
    NULL AS column_name,  -- Set column_name to NULL for table-level comments
    NULL AS is_nullable,  -- No nullability for table-level comments
    NULL AS data_type,    -- No data type for table-level comments
    obj_description(format('%s.%s', c.table_schema, c.table_name)::regclass::oid) AS table_comment,
    NULL AS column_comment, -- No column-level comments
    NULL AS constraint_type, -- No constraint type for table-level rows
    NULL AS referenced_table, -- No referenced table for table-level rows
    NULL AS referenced_column -- No referenced column for table-level rows
FROM information_schema.tables c
WHERE c.table_schema = 'public'

UNION ALL

SELECT
    c.table_name AS table_name,
    c.column_name AS column_name,
    c.is_nullable AS is_nullable,
    c.data_type AS data_type,
    NULL AS table_comment,  -- No table-level comments for column rows
    col_description(format('%s.%s', c.table_schema, c.table_name)::regclass::oid, c.ordinal_position::int) AS column_comment,
    tc.constraint_type AS constraint_type,
    rcu.table_name AS referenced_table,
    rcu.column_name AS referenced_column
FROM information_schema.columns c
LEFT JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu
    ON c.table_name = kcu.table_name
    AND c.column_name = kcu.column_name
LEFT JOIN information_schema.table_constraints tc
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    AND tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
LEFT JOIN information_schema.referential_constraints rc
    ON rc.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
LEFT JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage rcu
    ON rc.unique_constraint_name = rcu.constraint_name
WHERE c.table_schema = 'public';
```

The query should result in the following results:

columns:
- "table_name"
- "column_name"
- "is_nullable"
- "data_type"
- "table_comment"
- "column_comment"
- "constraint_type"
- "referenced_table"
- "referenced_column"

Download the results to a CSV file:

You can upload this csv and it will be processed to the JSON structure in left pane.
